# Fourth assignment(Visualisation)
### The fourth study point assignment can be found in the folder structure -> MP4 -> MP4.ipynb and Application folder for the streamlit visualisation. all you have to do is cd into the folder, and run -> streamlit run "the file name"
## I have made a next.js application to showcase how it can be implemented in an "real" webapplication.
